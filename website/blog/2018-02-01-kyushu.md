Anthony Christe was invited to attend [Energy Week 2018 at Kyushu University, Japan](http://www.congre.co.jp/q-pit2018/eng/index.html) and present ideas for collaboration between Kyushu University energy researchers and the Open Power Quality project. 

Our proposals for collaboration include topics of big data, hardware design, data analytics, and front-end web design.

Here's a [link to Anthony's poster](https://github.com/openpowerquality/energy-week-2018/blob/master/energy-week-2018.pdf) with more details.
