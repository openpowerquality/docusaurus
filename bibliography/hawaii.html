<blockquote><font size="-1">
Modernizing Hawai‘i’s Grid For Our Customers is a grid modernization strategy that describes the scope, purpose, and estimated cost of the work required to update the Hawaiian Electric Companies’ energy network in the next six years, and how it will help the five islands served by the Companies to achieve a renewable portfolio standard of 48 percent by 2020 and ultimately 100 percent by 2045. Achieving the renewable portfolio standard goals will require a combination of both customer-owned distributed resources as well as larger grid-scale resources

 HECO grid plan could enable 3x as much rooftop solar in Hawaii.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The draft grid modernization plan which HECO released late last week can be seen in light of these contradictions, as well as the requirement by state regulators that such grid modernization be done cost-effectively. After the state’s Public Utilities Commission rejected a 340 million grid modernization plan six months ago, HECO has come back with a plan whose first phase involves outlays of 205 million through 2023.
