	abstract = {This paper describes countrywide electrical power quality (PQ) assessments of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System through a genuine PQ database. The database stores the output of mobile PQ measurement systems which are established at 172 transformer substations of the transmission system. At 601 measurement points in these substations, which are potentially critical in terms of PQ, measurements are carried out by the mobile systems for a period of 1 week. PQ parameters defined in the IEC-61000- 4-30 standard in addition to power values are calculated from acquired raw data by the mobile-monitoring system and the resulting data are transferred to the PQ database. The database, based on a novel PQ data model, enables its users to take PQ snapshots of the transmission system countrywide and can be accessed through several interfaces including a visual query interface, a natural language interface, and a map interface. The overall PQ status of the measured points, representing the characteristics of the transmission system, is assessed through these interfaces and problematic points are determined while deriving important conclusions about the transmission system’s PQ behavior. Moreover, several novel PQ assessment methods are proposed and their applications on the PQ data are demonstrated especially through the map interface.},

	abstract = {Electric power as a commodity is very different from other products – it is generated far from the point of use, is fed to the grid together with the output of many other generators and arrives at the point of use via several transformers and many kilometers of overhead and possibly underground cabling. Quality check of power is very important. But it has constantly been polluted by both consumers (non-linear loads) and utility companies (due to increased use of semi conductor based power processors). Assuring the quality of delivered power to be good enough for the application at hand calls for measurement and study of power quality at the point of common coupling.

There are various categories of Power Quality issues. Issues related to voltage amplitude variations will include voltage sags/dips and voltage swells. Issue related to frequency is harmonics in the power system. Short term problems include transients and momentary interruptions. We have carried out a brief study of all these PQ issues, and problems caused by them.

Developments in the field of power electronics has brought tremendous power processing capability to engineers but it has also polluted the power system with harmonics. Then there are non linear loads that inject harmonics in the power system. Measurement and estimation of harmonics in power system has become one of the most important tasks in the hands of power system engineers for increasing reliability and quality of supplied power. For harmonic analysis FFT based schemes are unable to give enough information for PQ mitigation. So researchers have been attempting other methods to estimate harmonics in sampled voltage and current signals. Among these; least square estimation, for estimating amplitudes and particle swarm optimization with passive congregation, for estimating phase and frequency used together has most attractive features of compactness and fastness. We have developed a harmonic estimator based on LSE and PSOPC to estimate amplitude, phase and frequency of the sampled signal. We have used the estimator on real time data acquired using a digital storage oscilloscope in Electrical Machines Laboratory of Department of Electrical Engineering at NIT Rourkela. The results for estimating integral harmonics are attractive and encourage researchers to modify the estimator code to make it able to estimate inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics also.},

	abstract = {Power quality (PQ) is a raising concern in distribution grids of modern industrialized countries. The PQ monitoring activities of distribution system operators (DSO) and consequently the amount of PQ measurement data increases continuously. To keep the routine assessment of PQ levels efficient, new and automated tools for validating, analysing and visualizing these data are required. The paper illustrates the challenges of processing long-term PQ monitoring campaigns by using measurement data at 8 different sites in public low voltage (LV) networks for more than one year (64 weeks). The paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes the measurement campaign, the pre-processing of the data and an easy and flexible way for routine compliance assessment. The second part is dedicated to the comparison of two different global PQ indices for assessing an average site performance as basis for e.g. benchmarking purposes.},
